      'I have been involved in the development of APIs using Python and Golang, leveraging frameworks such as FastAPI, Flask, and Gin. I have deployed these solutions using tools like Python Anywhere and Render.com. All of my projects are containerized using Docker, ensuring optimal implementation. With the help of Render.com, GitHub, and Docker, I have automated the deployment of these projects. My experience also includes designing a package manager developed in Python for C++ projects, developing scheduled tasks (cron jobs), and creating Telegram bots. I have developed mobile and web applications using Google\'s Flutter, and I have experience with AWS services, with a focus on cloud databases (RDS) supporting my APIs. In terms of innovation, I am experimenting with NextCloud for private cloud solutions and doing some WebScraping for the creation of a Schedule app.',
